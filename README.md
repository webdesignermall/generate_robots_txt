# How to Update and Run
--- This is not a public repo. Just a private collection of files ---

This node.js file creates a new robots.txt file from the url_suffixes.txt file and constructs a new one. As I find new URL suffixes, I will commit a new version of the .TXT file.

New versions of the robot.txt file will be saved under robot_txt directory. The milliseconds since 1/1/70 will be appended so the current robot.txt file is not overwritten.
